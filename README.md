Brief Summary of the project : 

Primary Aim : 

➔ Since WiFi signals are omnipresent these days. We can easily find a WiFi access point in
a modern household. So we plan to build a ubiquitous Wi-Fi-based Gesture Recognition
System.

➔ We are planning to build a system that can detect simple gestures like swiping or
pushing. Thereafter we plan to use this system to control IoT devices through gestures.

➔ We collect different training data samples for a given gesture and feed it to an ML model.

➔ Metric to be used in the data set will either be
Received signal strength indicator(RSSI) ​ (or)​ Channel state information(CSI).

➔ We will be using a Machine learning model to predict the event performed.

➔ The Machine learning algorithm will be a supervised learning classification algorithm
and we have not decided on the specific algorithm.

A small detour from the prime aim : 

We gathered some data from a company , the data consists of .dat files which has the csi values for collected between receivers
when a man moves from one point to the other over a time span of 30 secs !

And it consists of 30 sub carriers with a sampling rate of 1Khz !

We are trying to analyse the data and thus want to predice whether there is a movement or not  !!!!


WORK IN PROGRESS !!!
